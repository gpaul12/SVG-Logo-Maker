# Overview

## The Challenge:

Build a Node.js command-line application that takes in user inputs to generates a SVG logo and saves it as "logo.svg" file. In addition, create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and the passing of all of the tests.

## Usage Instructions

1. Open the cloned repository in any source code editor e.g. Visual Studio Code.
2. Open integrated terminal on index.js
3. Enter “node index.js” in the command line
4. Through sequential order within the command line interface - the user will be presented with npm inquirer questions - the user will provide a response to each question and proceed.
5. Once completed a SVG file named "logo.svg" will be created.
6. At your discretion, you may rename the "logo.svg" file to the file name of your choice.
